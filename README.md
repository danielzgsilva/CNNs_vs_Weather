# CNNs vs Weather
Examining the effects of natural perturbations such as rain, snow, fog and occlusions on the most popular CNN models

## About
This repo allows you to easily train and test a few of the most popular convolutional neural network architectures on he Cityscapes dataset, modified to simulate naturally ocurring weather conditions and other perturbations.
## Getting Started
### Installation
Install dependencies
- PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy 
- PIL

Clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/danielzgsilva/CNNs_vs_Weather`
`cd CNNs_vs_Weather`

Download the Cityscapes dataset
